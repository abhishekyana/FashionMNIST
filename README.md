# FashionMNIST
Fashion MNIST dataset Classifier Neural Network.<br>
With 1 hidden layer(1000 nodes) acheived a result of 95% accuracy with single batch<br>
Hyperparameters are to be recalculated.<br>
Runnig the script:<br>
  1)Download Dataset from kaggle <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist">Here</a> and place it in this repo folder.
  2)Run the fmnistdata.py with python3, The dataset will be created "fashionmnistdata.d" with a dictionary.
  3)Run the fmnistmodel.py to view the results. Play with the hyperparameters and see the accuracy rates and feel free to edit the code.
Fashion MNIST Dataset Classifier Deep Learning Approach.
