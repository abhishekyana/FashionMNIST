<h4>Fashion MNIST dataset Classifier Neural Network.</h4> <br>
<h5>Runnnig the script:</h5><br>
  <t>1)Download Dataset from kaggle <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist">Here</a> and place it in this repo folder.<br>
  2)Run the fmnistdata.py with python3, The dataset will be created "fashionmnistdata.d" with a dictionary.<br>
  3)Run the fmnistmodel.py to view the results. Play with the hyperparameters and see the accuracy rates and feel free to edit the code.<br>
Fashion MNIST Dataset Classifier Deep Learning Approach.
With 1 hidden layer(1000 nodes) acheived a result of 95% accuracy with single batch<br>
Hyperparameters are to be recalculated.<br>
